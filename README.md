## Project Title: Innovation Engine.
### Introduction 
#### Our website addresses the challenges students and supervisors face in managing graduation projects by enhancing coordination and efficiency. The centralized system allows students to submit project ideas and match with available supervisors based on expertise and preferences. This reduces delays and frustration, while a built-in feature checks for project duplication, encouraging innovation.

#### Additionally, the platform fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, enabling faculties to request support from other departments. This promotes knowledge sharing and effective teamwork across various disciplines.

### Technology:
#### Backend: Python 
#### Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
#### Database: MySQL

### Launching Instructions:
#### To initiate the project, begin by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory. Create and activate a virtual environment. Ensure MySQL is properly configured with the appropriate credentials. Once these steps are completed, start the server to access the website. Detailed instructions will be provided subsequently.
